    1) Preheat oven to 350Â°. Place bacon on a microwave-safe plate lined with paper towels. Cover with additional paper towels; microwave on high 3-5 minutes or until partially cooked but not crisp. In a small bowl, mix garlic, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.
<br> 2) Starting at a long side, cut steak horizontally in half to within 1/2 in. of opposite side. Open steak flat; Pound with a meat mallet to 1/4-in. thickness.
<br> 3)Spread garlic mixture over steak; sprinkle with cheese. Layer with eggs and bacon to within 1 in. of edges; sprinkle with parsley. Starting with a long side of the steak, roll up jelly-roll style (along the grain); tie at 1-1/2-in. intervals with kitchen string.
