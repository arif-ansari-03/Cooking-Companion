<h3>Directions:</h3>
<p>
    1) Squeeze Rasgulla Balls
    <br>Remove rasgullas from the syrup one at a time. Place it in between the palm of your hands and gently squeeze out the syrup. Don't press too hard or they can crumble. Alternatively, use a lemon squeezer for this step. Repeat with all rasgullas and keep aside. 

    <br> 2) Prepare Rasmalai Base<br>
    Place a heavy bottom skillet on medium heat. Add ¼ cup water and then pour the milk. Adding water before milk prevents the milk from scorching at the bottom (my mom's tip).<br>
    When milk is warm to the touch (about 1 minute), use a whisk to stir in rabdi mix. Keep whisking gently until the mix is completely dissolved. Keep stirring lightly and bring it to a boil. That should take about 2 minutes. Check for sweetness and add sugar to taste (I add 2 tablespoons)
    <br>Add chopped nuts, saffron and cardamom powder and stir. Simmer the Rabdi for another 2-3 minutes, while stirring. At this stage, the consistency of rabdi should be similar to half and half - thicker than milk, but thinner than heavy cream.
    
    <br> 3)Finish and Chill<br> Add the rasgullas and stir gently to coat them with the rabdi mix. Simmer for 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover the pan. Let it rest for 10 minutes. After that, transfer to a serving dish and refrigerate for 4 hours, or until it's chilled to your liking.</p>
